This repository contains the code that we used to simulate the vaccination scenarios presented in this paper:

    Projecting the population-level impact of norovirus vaccines, Authors: Katia Koelle, Brooke Lappe, Ben Lopman, Max S.Y. Lau, Emma Viscidi, Katherine B. Carlson (published in the journal Epidemics in 2025)
 
Accessing Model Code

The code is written in Matlab (v R2023a).

All .m files called are prefaced with "main_". The .m files that are names "main_norovirus_....m" generate the outfiles that are then called by the .m files that are named "main_figureX.m" where X denotes the figure number from the published paper.
